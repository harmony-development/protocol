// # Postbox
//
// The postbox service forms the core of Harmony's server <-> server communications.
//
// It concerns the transfer of Events between servers, as well as ensuring reliable
// delivery of them.
//
// The semantics of events are documented in the event types. The postbox service
// is solely reliable for reliable pushing and pulling.
//
// ## Authorisation
//
// Requests are authorised using a serialized `harmonytypes.v1.Token` in the Authorization HTTP header.
// The `data` field of the token will be a serialized `AuthData` message.
// The private key used to sign is the homeserver's private key.
//
// ## Events
//
// In this section, we will use sender and recipient to refer to the servers
// sending the events and the server receiving the events respectively.
//
// At PostboxService startup, a sender should first Pull all receivers it had
// federated from before. If a receiver makes a Push to the sender while a Pull
// is going on, the Push should be processed after the Pull is completed.
//
// The sender will attempt to Push to the receiver. If the Push RPC fails more
// than X times (a recommended retry count is 5), the event will be dispatched
// to the sender's queue for the receiver. Unless the receiver pulls these events,
// all new events should be dispatched to the queue. No new Push RPC should be made
// before the queue is emptied. This ensures that events are always received in the
// right order.
//
// It is recommended that receivers try pulling periodically, for example, every
// 1 minute after the last Push RPC by the sender. This ensures that events are recieved.
service PostboxService {
  // Endpoint to pull events.
  rpc Pull(PullRequest) returns (PullResponse) {}
  // Endpoint to push events.
  rpc Push(PushRequest) returns (PushResponse) {}
