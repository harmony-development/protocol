// Harmony service for facilitating voice operations using WebRTC.
//
// # Usage (for client)
//
// 0. Call StreamMessage to be able to send RTC commands to server
// 1. Send Initialize over stream with guild_id and channel_id of the request set to the channel you want to join
// 2. Init device by using the RTP capabilities sent in the response message, which should be Initialized
// 3. Send PrepareForJoinChannel over stream with client rtp capabilities
// 4. Wait for PreparedForJoinChannel, which contains transport options
// 5. Connect both transports using the transport options on client
// 6. Send JoinChannel over stream containing RTP paramaters for your Audio track
// and DTLS paramaters for both consumer and producer
// 7. Wait for JoinedChannel, which confirms you have successfully joined the voice channel;
// handle other_users which will be described in 8 (UserJoined handling)
// 8. Handle UserJoined and UserLeft events appropiately
//   - For UserJoined; use the received consumer ID, producer ID and RTP parameters on your
//     consumer transport to consume the producer, afterwards send ResumeConsumer message
//     with the consumer ID, then if that's successful add the track to a `user ID -> Track` map
//   - For UserLeft, remove the user track from the `user ID -> Track` map 
//
// ## How this looks for servers
//
// 0. Receives StreamMessage, starts the socket
// 1. Waits for Initialize
// 2. Sends Initialized over stream with it's RTP capabilities
// 3. Receives PrepareForJoinChannel with client RTP capabilities
// 4. Sends PreparedForJoinChannel over stream with consumer and producer transport options
// 5. Receives JoinChannel, checks for DTLS parameters for consumer and producer transports
// and uses the RTP paramaters to create a producer for the client
// 6. Sends JoinedChannel over stream with the created producer ID and all other users' data (UserData)
// 7. When another user does 1 to 7, sends UserJoined over stream to all other users;
// when a user leaves the channel (when their stream ends), sends UserLeft to all other users
// 8. When receiving a ResumeConsumer message, unpauses the consumer corresponding to the consumer ID
//
